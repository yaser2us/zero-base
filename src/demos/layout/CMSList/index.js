      summary:
        '<p><b>4 tactics scammers use to get mule accounts online.</b></p>&#10;<p>Scammers have more than one way to trick you into becoming a money mule. Here&#8217;s what you need to know to stay safe.</p><p><b>What is a mule account?</b></p><p>Mule accounts are accounts that don&#8217;t belong to the scammer but the scammer has access to it to receive and transfer stolen money while keeping their identity hidden.</p><p><b>What happens to mule account holders?</b></p><p>Anyone who holds a mule account could be:</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>Detained for investigation</li>&#10;<li>Fined, jailed for 5 years or both</li>&#10;<li>Blacklisted by Maybank</li>&#10;<li>Unable to open a Maybank account in the future</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<p>Here are the 4 common scam tactics:</p>&#10;<p>1. Fake job advertisements </p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1665736258736_tr-s2u-awareness1.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>If you see a job ad that is too good to be true, it could be a scam! Many scammers set up fake job postings on social media or they may approach you via chats to get you to give them your ATM card and banking details for fake salary processing. Don&#8217;t fall for them!&#10;</p>&#10;<p>2. Loan sharks </p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1665736258756_tr-s2u-awareness2.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>Loan sharks usually prey on their victims with quick and easy cash loans. In return, they will ask for your ATM card and banking information to &#8216;check on your money in the bank&#8217;. They will then use your account to transfer illegal money and keep their identities hidden. &#10;</p>&#10;<p>3. Bank account rentals</p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1665736258763_tr-s2u-awareness3.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>ALL bank account rentals are scams. They&#8217;ll offer you payment for your ATM card and online banking details so scammers can use your identities to funnel illegal funds and hide their real identity.  &#10;</p>&#10;<p>4. Friends and family</p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1665736258725_tr-s2u-awareness4.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>NEVER give out your ATM card or banking details to anyone, not even your friends and family. More often than not, the reason given is to help them receive and/or transfer funds to third parties using your bank account.&#10;</p>&#10;<p><b>What to do when you&#8217;re unsure if your bank account is compromised?</b></p>&#10;<p>Whenever in doubt, you can visit semakmule.rmp.gov.my to check if your bank account is compromised or if the bank account you&#8217;re transferring to is a mule account. This website also allows you to make a report of any suspicious mule accounts.</p>',

      summary:
        '<p>The answer is: it&#8217;s never too soon! The earlier you start planning, the better. Where do I start? How much do I need to save? Fret not, we&#8217;re here to give you some pointers to kickstart your road to retirement!</p>&#10;<p><b>At what age should I start planning?</b></p>&#10;<p>The truth is &#8211; you should start as early as your 20&#8217;s or once you enter the workforce and start earning money. It&#8217;s pretty simple: the more funds you have, the more comfortable your retirement will be.</p>&#10;<p><b>Is EPF not enough?</b></p>&#10;<p>Your Employee Provident Fund (EPF), also known as KWSP, is a good start but there&#8217;s no harm in growing your funds to retire more comfortably. If you&#8217;re a salaried worker, your monthly EPF contributions come from both you and your employer.</p>&#10;<p>If you didn&#8217;t know, you can actually increase your employee contribution up to 11% (it was lowered to 9% because of the pandemic), so you can bump up your savings each month! In some companies, the employer&#8217;s contribution can be more than 13%. Want to know if you can negotiate this amount? Drop an email to your recruiter or HR to find out!</p>&#10;<p><b>Can I top up my own EPF contributions?</b></p>&#10;<p>Yes, you can! All you need is your EPF number. If you&#8217;re self-employed, visit<a href="www.kwsp.gov.my"> www.kwsp.gov.my</a> and set up an EPF account. You can even set up recurring transfers to your EPF account via Maybank2u, here&#8217;s how:</p>&#10;<p><b>Step 1:</b> On your MAE dashboard, go to &#8216;Maybank2u&#8217; at the bottom navigation bar</p>&#10;<p><b>Step 2:</b> Tap &#8216;Pay&#8217; &gt; Select &#8216;Payee&#8217; then key in &#8216;EPF&#8217;</p>&#10;<p><b>Step 3:</b> Follow the on-screen instructions to set up recurring payments</p>&#10;<p><i>Tip: Make your contributions now so you can earn dividends for this year in early 2023!</i></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666231227685_M2U_Retirement_02.png"><br>&#10;<p><b>I don&#8217;t know how much to save. How can I find out?</b></p>&#10;<p>Planning your retirement savings is easier than you think, it&#8217;s all about breaking down your expenses. Let us help you with the first step: start with the Maybank Financial Goal Simulator, tap the button at the end of this article to give yourself an stimate.</p>&#10;<p>This simulator calculates an estimated amount for you so you can gauge how much you&#8217;ll need to start saving!</p>&#10;<p><b>My savings goal is six figures. How can I reach it?</b></p>&#10;<p>Don&#8217;t be too alarmed if you see a large sum of money. That&#8217;s completely normal because the simulator factors in your retirement age, monthly expenses and the number of years you&#8217;d like the money to last too. Plus, there are other ways to grow your money apart from just investing it in EPF.

      title: 'Buying new vs used cars: Which is better?',
      summary:
        '<p>When it comes to buying a car, we all want to get the best bang for our buck. Here are four things you should know before deciding on a brand new or used car!</p>&#10;<p><b>1. Price: used cars are exponentially more affordable</b></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666230565153_M2U_NewOldCar_02.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>Used cars are a great way to get your dream ride for less. You can find a car that\'s just as affordable but with higher specifications. Of course, there are some things to look out for when buying a used car. You can start by researching the model\'s longevity, especially the engine, through reviews online! Then, check the car\'s full maintenance history, parts and servicing before you make a purchase.</p>&#10;<p><b>2. Maintenance: new cars are covered by the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty</b></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666230565295_M2U_NewOldCar_03.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>A new car might be more expensive than a used one, but you won\'t have to worry about costly repairs or regular maintenance. New cars would not surprise you with wear and tear, such as a broken gearbox or compressor, which could cost quite a bit to repair or replace. All of that is covered under your warranty. And also, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the car not starting in the morning or if the air conditioning will hold out during a heat wave!</p>&#10;<p><b>3. Insurance: used cars are cheaper to insure</b></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666230565261_M2U_NewOldCar_04.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>You can spend less on car insurance if you purchase a used vehicle! The market value of your car is one of many factors that go into determining your car insurance premium. So a cheaper car would translate to cheaper insurance. On top of that, you can transfer your No Claim Discount (NCD) to your next car to continue enjoying a discount on your insurance premium!</p>&#10;<p><i>Tip: Make sure to change the ownership of the car at the Road Transport Department (JPJ) before transferring your NCD.</i></p>&#10;<p><b>4. Car loan: banks offer lower interest rates on new cars</b></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666230565217_M2U_NewOldCar_05.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>When you\'re buying a new car, there are more financing options available to you. This means you can get a lower interest rate and more favourable terms. The downside of taking a loan for a used car is that the interest rate is higher than that of a new car.</p>&#10;<p><b>Should I buy a new or used car?</b></p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666230565261_M2U_NewOldCar_06.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>The decision of whether to buy a new or used car is up to you. Both options have their pros and cons, and it ultimately comes down to what&#8217;s important to you. Before you commit to a loan, having an idea of your monthly repayment can help when you&#8217;re putting together a budget. Tap on the button below and select \'Car Loan Calculator\' to estimate your monthly repayment amount.&#10;</p>&#10;<p>This article was first published in October 2022.</p>&#10;<p>Disclaimer: The information provided above is not to be construed as investment advice and/or the provision of financial planning services.

      summary:
        '<p>Did you know that scam apps (commonly .apk files) can steal SMS from your device? This means it can redirect your SMS TAC to a scammer and you won&#8217;t even receive a text at all.</p>&#10;<p>So, what can you do? Switch to Secure2u instead!</p>&#10;<p><b>How is Secure2u safer?</b></p>&#10;<p>Secure2u pairs your device to your Maybank2u account &#8211; ensuring that you can only authorise transactions on one registered device at a time. And, that helps to reduce your exposure to SMS TAC fraud too. Plus, it&#8217;s faster because you can approve transactions with just one tap.</p>&#10;<p><b>How do I use Secure2u?</b></p>&#10;<p>It&#8217;s quick and it&#8217;s easy: simply make an online transaction and you&#8217;ll receive a notification from your MAE app, on your registered device. Then, just &#8216;Approve&#8217; or &#8216;Reject&#8217; the transaction with one tap!</p>&#10;<p><i>Tip: Allow push notification for the MAE app, so you can easily access your Secure2u verification via push notification. No login required!</i></p>&#10;<p><b>How do I activate Secure2u?</b></p>&#10;<p>Just go to your dashboard and you&#8217;ll see &#8216;Secure2u&#8217; right under Quick Actions. Tap on it and follow the on-screen instructions to enable Secure2u.</p>&#10;<img src="https://img.maybanksandbox.com/2/cms/maya-img/1666248784274_tr-s2u-cooling-2.jpg"><br>&#10;<p>Activate Secure2u now so you can use it as soon as possible because it&#8217;s enhanced with a 12-hour activation period to prevent unauthorised transaction approvals and further safeguard your online banking security. </p>&#10;<p><i>Note: This 12-hour activation period only happens when you enable Secure2u on the MAE app for the first time or on a different device. </i></p>&#10;<p><b>This article was first published in October 2022.</b></p>&#10;',
